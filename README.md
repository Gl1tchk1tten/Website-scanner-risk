## ðŸ‘‹ About

Hi, this is one of my old tools I found, and I'm dropping it here to keep my GitHub active.  
Just install the requirements, launch it, and check if the sites you use are full of shady garbage or not.

FYI: ChatGPT only helped me with emojis for the threat levels.  
The rest is all me.  
Anyway, much love. Or not. Depends.
